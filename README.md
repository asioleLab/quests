# chat quests:
# Write a very simple chat server that should listen on TCP port 10000 for clients. The chat protocol is very simple, clients connect with "telnet" and write single lines of text. On each new line of text, the server will broadcast that line to all other connected clients. Your program should be fully tested too. (provide a link to your solution)



# For java, execute the code and then open terminal and launch 'telnet localhost 10000' in each terminal and begin to chat
# A good option is to use minimum 2 terminals, one for each writer.
